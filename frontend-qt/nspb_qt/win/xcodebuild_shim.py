"""`xcodebuild` for Windows: answers the questions the pipeline asks, refuses the rest.

The pipeline uses xcodebuild for exactly two things on the IPA path:

* `check_prereqs` wants `shutil.which('xcodebuild')` to succeed — but `driver.py` replaces that
  check entirely, so this is only for a user who runs the upstream script by hand.
* `toolchain()` records `xcodebuild -version` in the shader cache keys, so the same inputs are
  reused across runs. A stable, honest string keeps the key stable.

Anything that would actually *build* (a bare `xcodebuild`, `-project`, `-scheme`) exits non-zero
with a message pointing at the real path, because there is no Xcode here and pretending
otherwise would produce a confusing failure much later.
