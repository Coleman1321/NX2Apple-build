"""The Windows build path: everything the Qt front end needs to produce an IPA on a PC.

This package is imported **only on Windows** (see `nspb_qt.model`). On macOS it is never
touched, so a Mac build behaves exactly as before; importing it here is still safe, because
no module in it runs a subprocess or reads a Windows-only path at import time.

The upstream pipeline (`scripts/build_ipa_from_nsp.py`) is not modified: `driver.py` loads it
as a module and replaces the functions that assume a Mac. `shim/` covers the calls that cross
process boundaries, where a function replacement cannot reach.
