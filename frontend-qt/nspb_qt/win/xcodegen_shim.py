"""`xcodegen` for Windows: there is none, and this says so clearly.

xcodegen is a Swift program that generates `.xcodeproj` bundles. Nothing equivalent exists on
Windows, and none is needed: an Xcode project only makes sense as input to Xcode, which is
macOS-only. On Windows the app is assembled straight into `DmIOS.app` by `build_app.py`, so the
project-file step is not replaced — it is skipped, and `driver.py` marks the `--prepare-xcode`
option as Mac-only.

This stand-in exists for one reason: `check_prereqs` in the upstream script looks for
`xcodegen` on PATH and refuses to start when it is absent. `driver.py` replaces that check, but
a user who runs the upstream script directly should get an actionable message rather than
"xcodegen not found (brew install xcodegen)" — a Homebrew instruction on Windows.
